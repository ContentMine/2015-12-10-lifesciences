# ContentMine Workshop: mining for the life sciences

* [Event Details](#event-details)

* [Schedule](#schedule)


**From the volunteers and organisers of ContentMine and DNAdigest comes a new hackday!**

Tickets available [here](http://onlinesales.admin.cam.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&deptid=332&catid=1081&prodid=1484).

Content mining technologies hold much potential for maximising scientific discovery and the reuse of research through automatedly searching, indexing and analysing the scientific literature. This workshop aims to educate and engage researchers who are interested in using mining technologies in the biomedical and life sciences. 

You will receive training in retrieving full-text articles and automatically extracting useful facts before optionally having the opportunity to apply these skills to discovering genomic datasets in a [hackathon on Dec 11](https://github.com/ContentMine/2015-12-11-dnadigest) hosted by EMBL-EBI and [DNA Digest](http://dnadigest.org/), a Cambridge-based charity empowering efficient access and sharing of genomics data. Advice and some assistance with transport is available, places for the hackathon can be booked [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dnadigest-and-contentmine-hackday-tickets-19378933913).

The workshop is best suited to those with an awareness of using command line tools or enthusiasm to pick this up, but formal programming experience is not a requirement.

This workshop is offered at a heavily subsidised rate of Â£10 including lunch and refreshments and places are limited to 25. If you have any queries please email jenny@contentmine.org.
